Note: All bowtie alignments should be down from fasta files with chromosome headers in the format "Chr_#" (e.g. Chr_1)

Scripts:
python-hm/analyzeSP counts reads originating at 5' splice sites and total reads for each transcript (including introns)
towerHeight normalizes 5' splice site tower counts to total transcript counts from files generated by analyzeSP script. This script requires counts from the internal control RNA (included at a known concentration).
SPanalyzeExons counts reads for coding sequences
NormalizeToMature takes the output from SPanalyzeExons and normalizes to WCE samples. This should be similar to "spliceosome occupancy" as defined in Dumesic et al. Cell 2013
